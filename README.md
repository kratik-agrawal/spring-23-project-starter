# CS 131 Project done by Kratik Agrawal

not sure where i am going wrong or what i am missing. related to templates though.

There are three stages to the project; students are currently at the third. Thus, this folder contains the necessary bootstrapping code:

- `intbase.py`, the base class and enum definitions for the interpreter
- `bparser.py`, a static `parser` class to parse Brewin programs

- `interpreterv2.py`, a working top-level interpreter for project 2 that mostly delegates interpreting work to:
  - `classv2.py` which handles class, field, and method definitions
  - `env2.py` which handles the program environment (a stack-based approach to accommodate local variables)
  - `objectv2.py` which additional implements inheritance and method calling; most of the code is here!
  - `type_valuev2.py` which additionally manage type checking

- `interpreterv1.py`, a working top-level interpreter for project 1 that mostly delegates interpreting work to:
  - `classv1.py` which handles class, field, and method definitions
  - `env1.py` which handles the program environment (a map from variables to values)
  - `objectv1.py` which handles operations on *objects*, which include statements, expressions, etc; most of the code is here!
  - `type_valuev1.py` which has classes to create type tags

You can view the starter for [Project 1](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-project-starter/releases/tag/p1).

Some notes on your submission (for Project 3)

1. You **must have a top-level, versioned `interpreterv2.py` file** that **exports the `Interpreter` class**. If not, **your code will not run on our autograder**.
2. You may also submit one or more additional `.py` modules that your interpreter uses, if you decide to break up your solution into multiple `.py` files.
3. You **should not modify/submit `intbase.py` or `bparser.py`**; we will use our own when grading.

You can find out more about our autograder, including how to run it, in [its accompanying repo](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-autograder).
